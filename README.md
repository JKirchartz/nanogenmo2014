=============

Generate a 50,000+ word "book" based on the Voynich Manuscript. Uses the following resources:

* The Flickr API and Internet Archive Commons account to grab 18th century images based on specific themes like "biology" and "alchemy."
* Processes the resulting illustrations to match background colors and discard undesirable images.
* Uses a randomized corpus of the original Voynich Manuscript (in the EVA transcription) with a public domain Voynich-like font.
* Generates a set of themed "folios" based on the themes from the original manuscript.
* Converts the output using CSS3 paged media to print-ready PDF (requires a local installation of Prince XML).

The source code in this repository is in the public domain. Note that a mix of commercial and closed-source software is necessary to generate the final output.
